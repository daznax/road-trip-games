# road-trip-games

When you go on a long road trip, you definitely want to have fun and play games with you family!

There are three great games that you can play with this, all from you phone's browser:
1. Keeping track of how many unique license plate states you see
2. Counting Amazon delivery trucks and semis
3. The 'ABC' game, where you find a word one a billboard or building along the way for each letter in order
